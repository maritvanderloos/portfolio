Throughout my year of studying illustration, I followed a weekly course about the fundamentals of drawing and painting. I learned a lot about technique, composition, color theory, materials and more. 

Below are some of my favorite works that I made during this course. They include still lifes, abstract work and figure studies of (nude) models.
