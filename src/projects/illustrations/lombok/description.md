title: Lombok reportage
year: 2023

For this project, I created a visual reportage of Lombok, a neighbourhood in Utrecht where people from many cultural backgrounds live together. Through exploring the neighbourhood, talking to people, taking pictures and sketching my surroundings, I explored the theme of social aid and support in Lombok. 
<br>
In a large drawing, I documented three social facilities in the neighbourhood: a language café, a children’s center and a community center. What they all have in common is their goal of creating social coherence by opening a space where people can come together.

What I liked about this project was to combine research with illustrating. It was a special experience to visit these places, engage in their activities, talk to people and make life drawings.
