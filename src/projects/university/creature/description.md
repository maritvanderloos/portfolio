One of my first programming projects was creating this animal-like creature. It was made in Processing, a Java-based language designed for visual arts and interactive media. I built the creature entirely out of geometric shapes and lines, drawing inspiration from a riso-printed drawing I had made earlier.

When you click on the wall socket, the creature gets “electrocuted’: his whiskers get spikey.
