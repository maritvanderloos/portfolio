For this project, my three teammates and I collaborated with VIMO Solutions, a technology start-up focused on health and activity. As our client, they asked us to design a product that motivates office workers to increase their physical activity during work hours. 

We created a bunny that office workers can place on their desks and that notifies them when they should move. By flapping its ears, the bunny catches the user’s attention. Its screen provides instructions and suggests exercises, which the user can accept or reject using the buttons on the bunny’s paws. An integrated timer tracks the user’s total amount of exercise and adjusts its mouth expression accordingly: happy, neutral, or sad.

Throughout the design process, we used several methods to gather context and make well-grounded design decisions. We researched the state of the art, conducted an interview with the director of a legal company, sent out surveys, and conducted user tests. We created several paper prototypes to quickly visualise the product. First, we built a low-fidelity prototype out of cardboard to conduct user tests. Based on insights and feedback from those tests, we developed the final high-fidelity prototype. 

The exterior of the bunny is cut and engraved with a laser cutter out of plywood. The bunny runs on an Arduino Leonardo. We used a servo motor to move the bunny’s ears, an LCD screen for the eyes and LED lights for the bunny’s mouth. The code was written using Arduino software.
