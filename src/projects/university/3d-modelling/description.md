In a course on interactive visualization, I learned how to use Blender and Unity software for 3D modeling, animation and integrating these 3D assets into a game engine.

For my first project, I made a Japanese house in Blender. I modeled, UV mapped and textured every component of the house myself. Afterward, I exported the model to Unity, where I designed a terrain of mountains and plants around my house. I also integrated a character controller, added animations, and ultimately published the game online. You can play it through the following link: https://maritvdloos.itch.io/japanse-house-game-marit

I also modelled Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s design for an aerial screw. This model too was created in Blender and animated in Unity. Play the game version of it here: https://maritvdloos.itch.io/leonardo-project-marit
