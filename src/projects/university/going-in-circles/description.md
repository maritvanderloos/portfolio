For this project, I worked with a group to design an interactive art installation.  We were asked to create a system that evokes emotional experiences rather than focusing on practical use or functionality. As a theme, we explored the perception of time and productivity.
<br>
We built a large, circular tent-like installation with closed-off curtains dividing the inside space into three smaller booths. Three participants sat inside the booths and put on headphones. Each started in a different booth and, after a few minutes, switched to the next one. Through the headphones, we played audio with music and instructions.

In one booth, we placed a deck of cards and instructed the participant to build a card house. However, just as they were about to finish, a fan automatically turned on and blew their house away. The other two booths assigned similarly frustrating and pointless tasks. At the end of the experience, we handed the participants flyers with the text: 'Want to know who played against you?â€™ Inside, they found a mirror.

Our installation invites participants to reflect on how they spend their time, particularly in the context of modern Western work ethics. By simulating the constant drive for productivity and the endless cycle of work, we want to start a conversation about what it truly means to use time productively.
<br>
To research the emotional experience of the participants, we mapped interaction phases to specific emotions in an experience map. We tested different parts of the interaction with users to see if they elicited the intended emotions.

The tent is made from recycled bedsheets and drapes over an old parasol. With a sewing machine, I stitched the sheets together and made slits as doors. I lino printed all the flyers by hand and used reflective stickers as mirrors. I designed our logo as a clock to symbolise the theme of time.
