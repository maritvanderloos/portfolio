Etching is a traditional technique that uses copper to make prints. It involves many steps, including filing and sanding the copper plate, engraving the design with a needle, treating it with chemicals, inking the plate and finally running it through a printing press. I really like how much care goes into each print, and how every print turns out differently. These are some prints in which I experimented and practised with etching.
