Screen printing is a technique in which ink is pressed through a screen onto a surface. With each layer, you can add a new color to the final print. I experimented with this process by cutting out templates and taping them onto a screen to print design on paper and textiles. For one piece, I used a picture I took of a river as inspiration, turning it into an abstract three-color print.
