My favorite way to make prints is through lino printing. By carving a design into a soft sheet, then rolling ink over it and pressing it onto a surface, you can create prints. I love the slow process of carving, the texture and the look of the prints.

Apart from making many small and big prints, I also hosted a lino printing workshop for a group of friends, which was very fun.
