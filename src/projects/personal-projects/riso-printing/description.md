Risograph printing is a Japanse printing technology from the eighties. Using ink made from soybeans, it enables printing in layers, with each layer adding a different color to the final print. What I love about risoprinting is that it is a combination of technology and art. Initially designed as a cheap, efficient and eco-friendly way to print, it has since evolved into a bright, colourful art medium.

Below are some works in which I experimented with risoprinting drawings and pictures.
