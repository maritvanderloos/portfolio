        I am Marit van der Loos, a Creative Technology student based in Utrecht.
        In my studies at the University of Twente, I explore innovative ways to
        use technology, finding creative solutions to relevant problems. I love
        learning about technology and its role in society, designing products,
        making prototypes, and testing them with users.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before my current studies, I completed the first year of the Bachelorâ€™s in
        Illustration at the Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht. This experience challenged
        me to look at art in new ways, and helped shape my identity as an artist.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my projects, I love combining art and technology, connecting the analogue
        and digital worlds through a multidisciplinary approach. With my work, I
        want to make a positive impact by creating sustainable designs that help
        people or make them think.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I like to express myself creatively through drawing, painting,
        knitting, crochet and more. You can take a look at a selection of my projects
        on this website!
