        I am Marit van der Loos, a Creative Technology student based in Utrecht.
        In my studies at the University of Twente, I explore innovative ways to
        use technology, finding creative solutions to relevant problems. I love
        learning about technology and its role in society, designing products,
        making prototypes, and testing them with users. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Before my current studies, I completed the first year of the Bachelor’s in Illustration at
        the Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht. This experience taught me to
        look at art in new ways, and helped shape my identity as an artist. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my projects, I love combining art and technology, connecting the
        analogue and digital worlds through a multidisciplinary approach. With
        my work, I want to make a positive impact by creating sustainable
        designs that help people or make them think. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I express myself creatively through drawing, painting, knitting, crochet and more.
        Take a look at a selection of my projects on this website!
